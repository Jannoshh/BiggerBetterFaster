Replicating [Bigger, Better, Faster: Human-level Atari with human-level efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19452).

Put on hold for now.

Currently supports Q-learning on Atari with DQN and C51.

#### TODO:
- n-step Q-learning
- Impala CNN
- Shrink and perturb
- Prioritized Experience Replay
- SPR loss
- Data augmentation
